# Report Writing Organisation

To keep the repo organized and to avoid merge conflicts please follow this procedure:
1. Create a branch with your name
2. Write your sections in individual .tex files and put them in a folder with your name (these will later be included in the main document with \input). For an example see the Main.tex and mte/ImportingDEMs.tex
3. Images are stored in the img folder
