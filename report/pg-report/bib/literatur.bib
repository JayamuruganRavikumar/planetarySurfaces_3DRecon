abstract = {CAHVOR is a camera model used in machine vision for three-dimensional measurements. It models the transformation from the object domain to the image domain using vectors C, A, H, and V and corrects radial lens distortions with a vector O and a triplet R. In photogrammetric mapping the camera model is usually represented by collinearity equations with interior and exterior orientation parameters. In NASA's planetary missions the CAHVOR model has been widely used for rover navigation and scientific exploration. On the other hand, a photogrammetric model is often needed in mapping and photogrammetric data processing systems. This paper presents a method for conversions between the CAHVOR model and the photogrammetry model. A numerical example is given to validate the conversion equations.},

abstract="Camera-based driver assistance went from pure research level activities in the early 1990s to standard equipment products in vehicles nowadays. This change is due to both technological advances and algorithmic developments. Especially, stereo vision plays a vital role in advanced driver assistance systems. In this chapter, we lay the foundations of stereo vision, show the specific needs for driver assistance, and build up a processing chain combining motion estimation and stereo information. The combination is called 6D-Vision and allows velocity estimation on a pixel level. For efficiency reasons, an intermediate stereo representation called Stixels is introduced from which an object representation is derived. The final section describes future trends in stereo vision such as a combination with machine learning approaches.",

In this paper we present a procedure and solar radiation related data from which the diurnally, hourly and daily variation of the global, direct beam and diffuse insolation on Mars are calculated. The radiation data are based on measured optical depth of the Martian atmosphere derived from images taken of the sun with a special diode on the Viking cameras; and computation based on multiple wavelength and multiple scattering of the solar radiation."

abstract="The Alba Patera main graben zone is radial to the Tharsis bulge, indicating the importance of the Tharsis bulge-related peripheral rift tectonics. The concentric grabens around the Alba Patera area are also partly caused by crustal bending due to the central load of the Alba Patera volcano. These two graben sets partly coincide forming composite structures. Both tectonic systems were still active after the last major volcanic lava extrusions took place. After this, the crater chain grabens, radial to the northernmost part of the Tharsis bulge were formed. These collapse craters were evidently caused by the late-tectonic forces due to the northern Tharsis and adjoining lava loads, resulting in flexural tension and activating previous faults.",

	Abstract = {A very simple procedure has been developed to fit the first three moments of an actual phase function with a three parameter analytic phase function. The exact Legendre Polynomial decomposition of this function is known which makes it quite suitable for multiple scattering calculations. The use of this function can be expected to yield excellent flux values at all depths within a medium. Since it is capable of reproducing the glory, it can be used in synthetic spectra computations from planetary atmospheres. Accurate asymptotic radiance values can also be achieved as long as the single scattering albedo.},

	Abstract = {We summarize an advanced, thoroughly documented, and quite general purpose discrete ordinate algorithm for time-independent transfer calculations in vertically inhomogeneous, nonisothermal, plane-parallel media. Atmospheric applications ranging from the UV to the radar region of the electromagnetic spectrum are possible. The physical processes included are thermal emission, scattering, absorption, and bidirectional reflection and emissionat the lower boundary. The medium may be forced at the top boundary by parallel or diffuse radiation and by internal and boundary thermal sources as well. We provide a brief account of the theoretical basis as well as a discussion of the numerical implementation of the theory. The recent advances made by ourselves and our collaborators---advances in both formulation and numerical solution---are all incorporated in the algorithm. Prominent among these advances are the complete conquest of two ill-conditioning problems which afflicted all previous discrete ordinate implementations: (1) the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors and (2) the inversion of the matrix determining the constants of integration. Copies of the fortran program on microcomputer diskettes are available for interested users.},

@article{lyapustin2011,
	Abstract = {An aerosol component of a new multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) algorithm is presented. MAIAC is a generic algorithm developed for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which performs aerosol retrievals and atmospheric correction over both dark vegetated surfaces and bright deserts based on a time series analysis and image‚Äêbased processing. The MAIAC look‚Äêup tables explicitly include surface bidirectional reflectance. The aerosol algorithm derives the spectral regression coefficient (SRC) relating surface bidirectional reflectance in the blue (0.47 Œºm) and shortwave infrared (2.1 Œºm) bands; this quantity is prescribed in the MODIS operational Dark Target algorithm based on a parameterized formula. The MAIAC aerosol products include aerosol optical thickness and a fine‚Äêmode fraction at resolution of 1 km. This high resolution, required in many applications such as air quality, brings new information about aerosol sources and, potentially, their strength. AERONET validation shows that the MAIAC and MOD04 algorithms have similar accuracy over dark and vegetated surfaces and that MAIAC generally improves accuracy over brighter surfaces due to the SRC retrieval and explicit bidirectional reflectance factor characterization, as demonstrated for several U.S. West Coast AERONET sites. Due to its generic nature and developed angular correction, MAIAC performs aerosol retrievals over bright deserts, as demonstrated for the Solar Village Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) site in Saudi Arabia.},
