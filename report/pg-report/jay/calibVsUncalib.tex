In claibrated reconstruction we use the image plane coordinates, here the intrinsic and the extrinsic parameters are known. These parameters are used to rectify the images The epipolar geometry reduces the correspondance problem to a line search problem. We implement a template matching method to find the stereo correspondance, from which we can obtain the disparity calcualtion. The disparity map is used to obtain the points in the 3D space, which allows us to recreate the object. 

Uncalibrated Reconstruction does not have the knowladge of the camera parameters, they are estimated. We use feature matching methods to find unique image points for both the stereo images and find the fundamental matrix F using the least square method. The essential matrix is calculated from the fundamental matrix, in which we use SVD to get the rotation matrix and the translation matrix. After estimating the parameters the uncalibrated reconstruction follows the calibrated method. Where we find the correspondance using template matching to obtain the disparity map, which is used to calculated the 3D coordinates for the reconstructed object. The pipeline of calibrated and the uncalibrated method is explained in detail in the implementation section.
